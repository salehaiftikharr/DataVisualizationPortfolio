# Women in Tech — Infographic

<img src="../images/Women-in-Tech.png" alt="Women in Tech Infographic" width="600"/>

## What is this project?

This project is a data-driven infographic that highlights the gender disparities in the tech industry — from education pipelines to promotion rates and wage gaps. It brings together key statistics to tell a clear and visual story about the challenges women continue to face in tech, despite growing awareness and opportunity.

## Why did I build this?

As a woman in tech myself, this topic matters to me on a personal level. I’ve often found myself wondering why representation and equity still feel so distant, and I wanted to use data and design to help others see the broader picture. This infographic was a way for me to advocate, reflect, and hopefully spark a conversation — all through a format that’s accessible and visually engaging.

## How did I build it?

I started by gathering data from multiple reliable sources on education, employment, and income. I then used Python and Pandas to clean and organize the data, and Matplotlib to create initial chart components. Afterward, I brought the elements into Canva and Recraft.ai to design the layout, stylize the visuals, and make the final infographic polished and easy to digest.
